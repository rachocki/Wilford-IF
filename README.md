# Wilford-IF

###Current Build (0.01): 
- Contains 2 rooms, the study and the hallway. The study contains a very simple puzzle to get the player used to navigating the world and some flavor text explaining the situation of the player character. 
- Adds new actions: read, think, die, suicide (These last two at tester request. My beta players are weird.)
- Alters default printouts for successful: open, close, lock, unlock, take, drop
- Adds values: Mysteriousness (for objects used in puzzles), Readability (for books), Physical State (for living things)

###Current Goals:
- Compile complete list of actions that will require alterations to the default printouts.
- Alter default printouts for unsuccessful actions/clarifying questions.
- Develop puzzle and storyline plans outside of the study.
- Create a more nuanced system for NPC interactions (Considering using a number-based system similar to one developed in a different experimental file. Will be further developed before implementation.)
- Write up an introductory text and tutorial statement that the player can access via a tutorial or hint command.

###Known Bugs/Errors:
- None
